# Speech_based_play_music_and_recommendation

To run this project, you will need to follow the steps below:

1) Install Python 3 or above on your computer.
2) Clone the repository or download the project files from GitHub.
3) Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4) Run the following command: python python.py
5) The program will start listening for the wake word "Hey My." Once it hears the wake word, you can give it a command to play music or recommend a song.
6) To stop the program, say "stop" or press "Ctrl + C" in the command prompt or terminal.

Note: You will need an active internet connection for this program to work since it uses the Google Speech Recognition API and Pywhatkit module to search and play music on YouTube.
